## Description
In life, you only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you. How do we make sure that you use your 1 minute to actually say something meaningful?

In the application the users will submit their one minute pitches and other users will vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them.

The pitches are organized by category.
